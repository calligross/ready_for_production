title: "Cars Model Application (API)"
output: github_document

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The code here creates a [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) application that
interacts with the cars model API defined in [model-api](../model-api). A
deployed version of the application can be accessed
[here](https://colorado.rstudio.com/rsc/car-model-app/).

The [`config`](https://github.com/rstudio/config) package is used to identify
where the API is hosted (either localhost or on [RStudio
Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/)). When run locally, this
application uses the default configuration, which expects the Plumber API to be
running locally on `localhost:5762`. When this application is deployed to
RStudio Connect, it looks for the API hosted at
https://colorado.rstudio.com/rsc/carmodel.
